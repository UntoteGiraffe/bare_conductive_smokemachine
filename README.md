# bare_conductive_smokemachine
Project for digitec.ch. Using a Bare Conductive Touch Board, we activate a smoke machine whenever a door is opened.
## Goal
A modified version of the default code that activates an electronic circuit whenever the electric paiunt is touched. Instead of direct contact, it operates on proximity now.
## Bugs
* Depending on which door you want to use this on, you might have to modify certain values in the code. 
* Account for daylight
## Development
This file is pretty much done as is. There are no current plans for further development.
